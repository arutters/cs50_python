# sequences in python are similar to arrays in other languages
# there are several different data structures we're going to discuss

# # sequence 
# name = "Harry"
# print(name[0]) 
# # returns "H"

# # list
# names = ["Harry", "Ron", "Hermione"]
# print(names[0])
# # returns "Harry"

# # tuple this is data structure where you have a pair of immutable values
# coordinateX = 10.0
# coordinateY = 20.0
# #this is an example of a tuple-sequence of immutable values
# coordinate = (10.0, 20.0)

# set collection of unique values. like a list, but each value must be unique!
# no example provided

# dict collection of key-value pairs
# think of a dictionary where you look up a word and you find the defintion of that word
